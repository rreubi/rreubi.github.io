	<h1>Zayn's History</h1>
		<p>Zayn Malik was 17 years old when he auditioned for the X Factor. Zayn was an overall great solo singer but not a great performer. Zayn struggled with performing anxiety and that caused him to get cut from the earlier rounds of the competition. But this was not the end for Zayn because after being cut from the solo act the judges decided to bring him back with a few other boys to form a new boy band group for the competition.</p>

		<p>After the X Factor competition the band made a huge career for themselves. Zayn played a huge role in One Direction’s success. Zayn was a major help in writing the band's songs, and always sang jaw-dropping high notes to leave fans in shock with him.</p>

		<p> Despite the band's huge success, in 2015 Zayn announced that he would be splitting ways with the band. Zayn claimed he wanted to be a regular guy again and have some time out of the spotlight for a while.</p>

		<p>Zayn’s time out of the spotlight only lasted a couple of months while he worked hard on his new solo work. Zayn started releasing his first solo album in early March of 2016. Zayn’s solo career immediately took off as one direction fans and many new fans as well-loved his new music. </p>

		<p>Over the years Zayn has now released 3 top-selling and highly loved albums. Unfortunately, Zayn has never taken these amazing albums on tour due to his high amounts of anxiety. Even though without a tour fans still love listening to Zayn’s music giving him almost 160 million  streams on Spotify.</p>


		<p> Zayn has continued to pursue his love for music through his own style and has promised to fans that more new music is on the way, and fans can not wait for it.</p>
