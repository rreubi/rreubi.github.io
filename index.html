		<section>
		<h1>Formation Of The Biggest Boy Band In The World</h1>
		
		<p>In 2010 the boy band One Direction was formed on the British singing show The X Factor. The boys started off as single artists, but when they didnâ€™t make it to the next round, the judges decided to put them together and create a boy band. A couple of years later after their formation, One Direction became one of the biggest Bands in the world.</p> 
		<p>The Band consisted of 5 members. 
			<a href="harry.html">Harry Styles</a>,<!--links to the other pages as well so you dont just have to use the nav-->
			<a href="niall.html"> Niall Horan</a>,
			<a href="liam.html">Liam Payne</a>, 
			<a href="louis.html">Louis Tomlinson</a>,& 
			<a href="zayn.html">Zayn Malik</a>. The boys were ages 16-18 when they started, and they had no idea how big that they were going to get. After their first album, Up All Night, was released it took off immediately.</p>
		<p>After the first album was released, and since it was such a big success, the boys went on their first world tour in 2011. And their success kept continuing to grow, and the Directioners' fan base became a worldwide group of lovers for the band.</p>
		<p> The boys continued to make and produce music, coming out with 3 more super successful albums.</p>
		<p> In 2015, the band had most likely hit the peak of their career They had released 4 albums, and gone on 5 worldwide tours. In early 2015 one member, Zayn Malik, announced his withdrawal from the group to work on his solo career.</p>
		<p> After Zayn left the group continued as just the 4 of them and managed to create another top-seller album. Even though the album was a success the band announced their indefinite hiatus in December 2015.</p>
