	<h1>Liam's History</h1>
	
	<p>Liam first auditioned for the X Factor in 2008 when he was only 14. He only made it to the second round of the competition before the judges sent him home. Liam didn’t let this set him back, and 2 years later he auditioned again in 2010. After his second audition, Liam was placed with 4 other boys to make a boy band, as we know as One Direction .</p>

	<p> Fans all over the world had followed loved and supported Liam throughout his entire career and that didn't end when he started making his own music. After the band started taking their break Liam had instant success in his solo career, releasing his first single,” Strip That Down”, in 2017.</p>

	<p>Liam has continued to make and release music. With working with many other very talented artists Liam has released many collaboration songs.</p>

	<p> At the start of his solo career Liam started dating Cheryl Cole, and together they had a son who they named Bear. Liam has said that he wanted to write a song and dedicate it to Bear but he decided not to because he didn't want Bear to be embarrassed in the future.</p>

	<p>Liam scheduled his First national tour in 2020, but because of a world pandemic, his tour got canceled. Instead of just stopping performing, Liam created a 3 part online show where fans could virtual tickets to watch the live stream of the show. </p>
